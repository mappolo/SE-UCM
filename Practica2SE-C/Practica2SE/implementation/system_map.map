Design Summary
--------------

Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    0
Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Flip Flops:         1,172 out of  15,360    7%
  Number of 4 input LUTs:             2,230 out of  15,360   14%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:          1,490 out of   7,680   19%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:   1,490 out of   1,490 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of   1,490   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:       2,271 out of  15,360   14%
    Number used as logic:             1,746
    Number used as a route-thru:         41
    Number used for Dual Port RAMs:     384
      (Two LUTs used per Dual Port RAM)
    Number used as Shift registers:     100

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

  Number of bonded IOBs:                 20 out of     173   11%
    IOB Flip Flops:                      20
  Number of RAMB16s:                     16 out of      24   66%
  Number of MULT18X18s:                   3 out of      24   12%
  Number of BUFGMUXs:                     1 out of       8   12%

Average Fanout of Non-Clock Nets:                4.07
